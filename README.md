I hold a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and a master's degree in Data Science. My professional interests lie in the areas of machine learning, deep learning, and algorithmic problem solving using Python. I am particularly focused on building end-to-end data-driven solutions, ranging from data preprocessing and model development to deployment. I am also interested in computer vision, natural language processing, and model interpretability. 

This GitHub repository serves as a platform to showcase selected personal and professional projects, experiments, and research in the field of data science.
